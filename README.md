# A Nonlinear Approach to the Riemann Hypothesis

**Structured Chaos, Phase Coherence, and the Harmonic Lattice**

---

## Overview

This project introduces a nonlinear phase coherence framework to explore the Riemann Hypothesis (RH), rooted in Structured Chaos Theory and formalized through the Recursive Phase Convergence (RPC) Theorem.

Through a harmonic lattice model, the framework reinterprets the prime-indexed phase structure underlying the critical line. Using symbolic compression, analytical thresholds, and high-precision computational illustrations up to $T=10^{15}$, it invites a new nonlinear lens on RH and the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis (GRH).

All simulations, proofs, and analyses were conducted with **Firefly v3**, an open-source GPU-accelerated computational engine built for harmonic attunement and nonlinear mathematical exploration.
